# Deploy-PHP-Application-in-AWS

Abstract
A handful of the guided labs and challenge labs that we have already completed in our earlier tasks are effectively combined in this capstone project. 
The primary objectives of the capstone project are to deploy the PHP application (web app) that runs on EC2 and to create an RDS database for the PHP application 
to query and interact with it. Then we need to secure the application to prevent public access to the backend database systems and update the necessary 
parameters in the AWS parameter store. For the web application to scale in response to user demand, we need to build an auto-scaling group and load balancer. 
We must utilize the four parameters listed in the AWS lab instructions to connect to the database. We are also provided with an SQL dump and the PHP files that 
can be used to build the solution.
